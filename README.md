## Mongoose-Prefix

Basically change discord-bot prefix with mongodb. 
for discord.js v13

**If you need help add me on [discord](https://discord.com/users/244847249866096640) I will provide you all help. ❤️**

### Setting up

If it's your first discord-bot you can clone the project.



First of all, make sure that the following applications are installed completely.

1. You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.16.0 or higher.
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chillyixa/mongoose-prefix
```
##### Before starting

Before you start the bot you'll need to change the name of `config.json.example` to `config.json` and then add your bots token along with mongoose connection url.

```js
{
"prefix": "Bot default prefix",
"token": "Discord bot token",
"mongodb_sv": "Mongo connect url"
}

```

##### Install modules

- Launch an Therminal in the bot directory

- `npm i ` or `npm install`  

##### Launch bot

First make sure all modules are downloaded without any problems. Then you can start the bot using `node index.js`. I recommend starting your bot using **[nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon).**
